Looper plugin for LV2, specifically for the Mod Devices pedal board.

Usage:

 - Adjust the "Threshold" to only start recording once playing has started. If set to the lowest value, recording will start immediately. Otherwise it will start recording when the first sound comes in. The threshold can be used to filter out noise.
 - Adjust the "Dry Amount" to reduce the volume of the input signal directly routed to the output. Setting it to 0 means you will only hear any looped sounds, no direct sound.
 - Press the "Activate" button to start recording the first dub. Press again to stop recording. The first dub's length will define the length of all loops. Recording of all but the first dubs will stop when the loop length is reached. There is one exception: When the threshold is configured and no audio was recorded yet, then recording will not stop at the end of the loop.
 - Double press the "Activate" button to reset the looper, clearing all loops.
 - Press the "Undo" button to go back one dub. Undoing the first dub will also stop playing.
 - Press the "Redo" button to redo a dub. Redoing is possible as many times as undo was used before. Redoing the first dub will start playing again. Redoing is no longer possible when the next dub record is started! This will invalidate all undone dubs!
 - Press the "Reset" button to stop recording if it is recording. Otherwise do the same as the "Undo" button.
 - Double press the "Reset" button to reset the looper, clearing all loops.
 - Press the "Dub" button to start recording a dub. When pressed while recording, the last dub is finished and immediately it starts a new one.
 - Double press the "Dub" button to reset the looper, clearing all loops.
 - Note that any of those buttons can be assigned to the hardware buttons of the Mod board! Thus you can select which functionality you need.
 - The parameter Continuous Dub controls if after the first dub recording continuous. The default is off, but with the on setting it behaves like most other loopers.
